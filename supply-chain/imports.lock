Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at

think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

Biggest non-trivial change is a new UEFI back-end, which looks reasonable to
the best of my ability: There's some trickiness on initialization but doesn't
look unsafe, at worse it leaks, and it might not if the relevant pointers are
static/non-owning. Other changes also look reasonable too: some tweaks to
inlining and a syscall-based linux back-end, whose relevant unsafe code looks
reasonable.

also has a large, thorough test suite. The project claims to run tests with
Miri to have stronger soundness checks, and also claims to use formal
verification tools to prove correctness.
