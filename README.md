# embedded-mcu

This houses a colletion of MCU agnostic traits + libraries to manipulate hardware peripherals. It is similar to embedded-hal except mapping to high level of abstraction like USB C PD and HID. Some of the traits housed here will be upstreamed to embedded-hal if the community aligns to the same vision.

This repo is not intended to link to any MCU specific code.
